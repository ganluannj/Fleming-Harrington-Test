## Fleming-Harrington-Test
Fleming-Harrington test is a statistical test to test the difference of several
survival distributions. This test is used when analysts want to emphasize
early, middle, or late departures in survivals. Different emphasis was controlled by two parameters. From the aspect of statistical inference, these
two parameters should be determined before performing experiment/clinical
trials and observing data. And parameters can be determined based on experience or previous experiment/clinical trial results. However in lacking of
experience or previous results, a commonly used but wrong procedure was to
investigate data first and then determine parameters and perform the test.
We used a data from a lung cancer trial to show this wrong procedure. Simulation was then used to show that real type I error of test used in this
procedure can not be well controlled. One way to solve this problem is to
split the data into two independent parts with one part used to determine
test parameters. After determining the test parameters, the other part of
data can be used to do the real analysis. Our simulation results show that
type I error is well controlled for test conducted in this manner. However, power of this procedure is relatively low, since sample size used the formal
test is less than the real sample size. Thus another possible way is to invent a new test based on the Fleming-Harrington test and this data splitting
method. This new test should control type I error and have a high power.
Developing this kind of tests could be the follow up research.
